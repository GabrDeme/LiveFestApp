## Problem to be Solved

In the midst of the vast array of events happening daily in a bustling city like São Paulo, it is common for many of them to go unnoticed by the general public. People often feel disconnected from the cultural and entertainment opportunities available in their own communities due to a lack of advertising and available time.
